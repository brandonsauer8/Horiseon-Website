# Code Refactor Starter Code
This is a this is a website for a marketing agency. It follows accessibility standards and is optimzed for search engine. 
A relevent title has been added so the user knows what the website is called and so it can be found in a search engine.

It has also been fixed so that all of the buttons in the navigation bar bring the user straight to the content that they are looking 
for on the page. The styling codes have been reorganized and combined to put it in order of semantics and to make for a cleaner code. 

There are also comments where each section of the website coding ends and has alt tags in the html so that if the image can't load for the user, they can still see what the image is supposed to be through text. I have also organized the html into different sections instead of using the same div in order to make it more readable. The user is going to have an easy time navigating through this page.
